            Hi there! Thanks for being here. </br> </br>
            My name is Philisha and this website is meant to serve as an ever-evolving work-in-progress portfolio / archive of my work. </br> </br>
            As you'll see once you click on the "projects" tab, the thematic interest of my diverse endeavours often lies in the intersections of identity, technology and art. </br> </br>
            Through the discursive queering and applicatory re-imagination of the realm of the Digital, I envision emancipatory and participative presents. </br> </br>
            In particular, I am intrigued by the potential of (digital) imaginaries and technologies as subversive tools for the creative (de-)construction of -self as well as the aesthetic re-conceptualisation of gendered (corpo-)reality. </br> </br>
            I am based in Berlin and do project based freelance work in different functions, such as (digital) creator, curator and facilitator - often through the dgtl fmnsm collective, which I am a proud member of.
